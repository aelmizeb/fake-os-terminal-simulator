# Contributing to fake-os-terminal-simulator

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 🎉  
We welcome issues, improvements, bug fixes, and new features that align with the project goals.

## 🧰 Requirements

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aelmizeb/fake-os-terminal-simulator.git
   cd fake-os-terminal-simulator
   ```

2. **Use a local development server**:

   You need to run a simple HTTP server to execute the project (because of the use of fetch())

Check for any console errors or crashes when running.
